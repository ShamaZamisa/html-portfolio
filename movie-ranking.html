<h1> The Best Movies according to Shama </h1>
<h2> My top 3 movies of all time. </h2>

<hr />

<h3> Guess Who </h3>
<p>I generally love comedy. It's a hilarious movie that documents an interacial couple falling in love and the racial tensions that ensue when the girl's family wants to meet the guy.</p>
<h3> Shaolin Soccer</h3>
<p> I love the fact that it is an overanimated, exaggeration of a movie. A break from reality.</p>
<h3>Black Panther</h3>
<p> A movie about the only African that eluded colonization by keeping its valuable natural resources a secret from the outside world.</p>
